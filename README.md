# Gem City Swing

This is the website for [Gem City Swing](https://www.gemcityswing.com/), Dayton's local Swing #Dance scene. We host a weekly social dance. Our mission is to preserve the rich heritage of jazz music and dancing.

# How To Update

The Gem City Swing Website is a static site, using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).  You don't actually need to know this to update the website, but in case something goes wrong, the documentation on these sites is a good place to start!

These instructions are geared towards someone with some technical experience, but not necessarily a lot.  If you can understand how to edit a file and are willing to learn a new thing or two, this is for you!

## Content

Content for a hugo website is all stored in the `/content` folder.

## Editing files

If you aren't familiar with editing files from github, the easiest way to do it is to navigate to any file, click on the arrow next to the pencil icon, then click "open in github.dev".  This will open a text editor with all of your files and folders to the left.  From here you can easily create, edit, or delete content.

## Saving and deploying changes

Once you are happy with your changes, click on the icon that looks like 3 circles with some lines connecting them to left.  This will bring up a view that shows all of your changed files.  In the text bar (Labeled `message`), type a short description of what you're trying to do to the website.  GitHub tracks who changed what and why, making it easy to undo changes if necessary.  Once you've done that, you can click `Commit & Push`.  Once pushed, your website will start to be built in the background, and should be live shortly!
