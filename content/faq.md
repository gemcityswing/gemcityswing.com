**Do I need to know how to swing dance?**

No! We offer an hour-long beginner-friendly lesson before every social dance to help you nail down the basics. See our Fundamentals class description on the Weekly Events page!

**Do I need a partner for the lesson?**

Definitely not! We rotate partners often during lessons, so everyone has a chance to try the moves with everyone. Feel free to show up by yourself, with a partner, or with a whole group!

**Do I need a partner for the social dance?**

It’s customary to try and dance with lots of different people, so if you show up, expect to get asked to dance…and don’t hesitate to ask strangers to dance too!

**Can anyone attend weekly dances?**

Yes! Everyone is welcome–come dance with us! 

**How can I pay?**

We accept either cash or card

**What do people wear swing dancing?**

Whatever clothes you feel comfortable in! At weekly dances, typical clothes range from athletic apparel to dressy. When we have special events like band nights, many people like to dress up a little, but always default to what you are comfortable moving around in. Check out our social media pages for ideas!

**What shoes should I wear?**

Wear whatever you are most comfortable moving around in - think secure on your feet and closed toe. Tennis shoes or Converse are popular. Dance or other shoes that don't have a lot of traction tend to be the easiest to dance in!

**What should I bring?**

Please bring a water bottle to stay hydrated. We will have water available for refills.  Also, if you happen to have a hand fan bring it if you plan on dancing a lot, you will thank yourself later! 

**When asked to dance, must I say yes?**

While strangers will ask strangers to dance, you can of course feel free to decline! Saying “no” or “maybe later” to a dance is perfectly acceptable if you’re tired, thirsty, or just don’t want to dance with the person. No explanation is needed! For more info check out our [Code Of Conduct]({{< ref "code-of-conduct.md">}}).

**Someone is making me feel uncomfortable! Help!**

Please talk to the DJ, the instructors, or the desk workers, and they’ll put you in contact with a board member. We have a safe spaces policy at our dances and we want everyone to have as good a time as possible. If someone is making you uncomfortable, they’re likely making others uncomfortable too, but we can’t address the situation until we know it exists. For more info check out our [Code Of Conduct]({{< ref "code-of-conduct.md">}}).

**You guys are a lot of fun. How can I support you?**

We’re glad you asked! There are a number of ways you can support us:

* Keep attending dances and lessons!!
* Bring a friend to a dance. Dances are more fun the more people we have in attendance!
* Buy a membership. As an official member of the organization, you are entitled to a number of perks, so if you think you might keep dancing for a while, consider purchasing a membership!
* Volunteer: We can always use more members who are willing to greet people on their way in, DJ, or even help set up or tear down for the night! Contact a board member or club volunteer to get more information.
